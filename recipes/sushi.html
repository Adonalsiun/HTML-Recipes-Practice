    <h4>What Is Sushi?</h4>
    <p>
        Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that consists of vinegared 
        rice, often accompanied by various ingredients such as seafood 
        (both raw and cooked), vegetables, and sometimes egg or tofu. 
        The rice is seasoned with sweetened vinegar and shaped into bite-sized 
        pieces or formed into rolls with seaweed or other ingredients.
