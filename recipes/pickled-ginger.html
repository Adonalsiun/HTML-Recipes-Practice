    <h4>What Is Pickled Ginger?</h4>
    <p>
        Pickled ginger is called gari or amazu shoga in Japanese. 
        It's served with sushi or sashimi and helps enhance the flavors 
        and clear your taste buds. It's also great with Century Eggs, a 
        Chinese delicacy. You can find prepared pickled ginger in pink or 
        white at most Asian markets but I prefer to make my own and share 
        with family and friends.
